## Assignment Description

In this assignment, your task is to replicate a product page from Decem Drinks using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will not be required to copy the entire page, but you must cover specific elements of the page as outlined below. It is important to note that the layout does not need to be pixel-perfect, but you should aim to replicate the key features accurately.

### Key Elements to Replicate

1. **Header and Dropdown + Announcement Bar:**
   - Replicate the header section, including the navigation menu, logo, and the dropdown menu that appears when you click on the "+" symbol.
   - Implement the announcement bar if available.

2. **Cart Drawer:**
   - Create a cart drawer on the right-hand side, which appears when an item is added to the cart.
   - Ensure that users can interact with the cart, adding and removing items as needed.

3. **Accordion Items:**
   - Implement accordion-style sections for Description, Taste, and Serve.
   - Users should be able to expand and collapse these sections as required.

4. **Inspect Element and Layout:**
   - Use the browser's Inspect Element feature to understand the layout and structure of the original page.
   - While pixel-perfect replication is not required, try to replicate the general layout and structure of the original page as closely as possible.

5. **Carousel:**
   - Implement a carousel that allows users to navigate through product images.
   - Ensure that the carousel functions as expected, allowing users to move between images smoothly.

### Additional Notes

1. Making the page responsive is optional but preferred. You are encouraged to consider various screen sizes and adapt the layout as needed.

2. Use Tailwind CSS: Preferably, use Tailwind CSS for styling, as all website builds at our organization use Tailwind.

3. Original Website Animations: Ensure that you replicate all the original website's animations to the best of your ability.
